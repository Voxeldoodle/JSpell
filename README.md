# JSpell
Java version of the Spell log parser
# Description
Porting of the parsing functionality from the spellpy package from [nailo2c](https://github.com/nailo2c/spellpy) which in turn is derived from [logpai's logparser](https://github.com/logpai/logparser),
both referring to the [original paper](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/papers/spell.pdf) `Spell: Streaming Parsing of System Event Logs` from Min Du, Feifei Li @University of Utah.
